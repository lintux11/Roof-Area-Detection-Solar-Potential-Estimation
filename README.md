# Roof-Area-Detection-Solar-Potential-Estimation
This project detects usable rooftop areas from satellite images using computer vision and machine learning. A CNN based segmentation model identifies roof surfaces and filters non usable regions. The extracted area is combined with solar irradiance data to estimate solar energy potential and support informed solar panel planning.
